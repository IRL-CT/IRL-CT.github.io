## Project Overview

This project explores how collaborative visualization tools can enhance scientific discovery through shared data exploration. We are developing a suite of web-based visualization tools that allow distributed research teams to simultaneously explore and analyze complex scientific datasets.

### Research Questions

1. How do scientists currently collaborate around data visualization?
2. What synchronous and asynchronous collaboration features best support scientific workflows?
3. How can visualization tools support awareness of team members' activities and insights?

### Methodology

Our research combines:

- Ethnographic observation of scientific teams
- Iterative design of collaborative visualization prototypes
- Controlled user studies evaluating specific collaboration features
- Longitudinal deployment studies with partner research labs

### Current Progress

We have completed our initial contextual inquiry with three scientific research teams and identified key collaboration challenges. Our first prototype supports real-time collaborative exploration of multi-dimensional datasets with features for:

- Synchronized views
- Annotation and discussion
- Exploration history tracking
- Insight sharing

### Get Involved

If you're interested in participating in our user studies or deploying our tools in your scientific team, please contact [jane-doe@cornell.edu](mailto:jane-doe@cornell.edu).
