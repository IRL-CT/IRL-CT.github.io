summary: "Unpleasant social interactions on the road can negatively affect driving safety. We recorded nine families going on drives and performed interaction analysis on this data. We define three strategies to address social discomfort: contextual mediation, social mediation, and social support. We discuss considerations for engineering and design, and explore the limitations of current large language models in addressing social discomfort on the road."
