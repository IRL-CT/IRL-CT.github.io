summary: "High-fidelity driving simulators can act as testbeds for designing in-vehicle interfaces or validating the safety of novel driver assistance features. 
In this system paper, we develop and validate the safety of a mixed reality driving simulator system that enables us to superimpose virtual objects and events into the view of participants engaging in real-world driving in unmodified vehicles. To this end, we have validated the mixed reality system for basic driver cockpit and low-speed driving tasks, comparing the use of the system with non-headset and with the headset driving conditions, to ensure that participants behave and perform similarly using this system as they would otherwise.
