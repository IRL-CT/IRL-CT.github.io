summary: "The maker movement embodies a resurgence in DIY creation, merging physical craftsmanship and arts with digital technology support. However, mere technological skills and creativity are insufficient for economically and psychologically sustainable practice. By illuminating and smoothing the path from “maker" to “maker entrepreneur," we can help broaden the viability of making as a livelihood. Our research centers on makers who design, produce, and sell physical goods. In this work, we explore the transition to entrepreneurship for these makers and how technology can facilitate this transition online and offline. We present results from interviews with 20 USA-based maker entrepreneurs (i.e., lamps, stickers), six creative service entrepreneurs (i.e., photographers, fabrication), and seven support personnel (i.e., art curator, incubator director). Our findings reveal that many maker entrepreneurs 1) are makers first and entrepreneurs second; 2) struggle with business logistics and learn business skills as they go; and 3) are motivated by non-monetary values. We discuss training and technology-based design implications and opportunities for addressing challenges in developing economically sustainable businesses around making.
